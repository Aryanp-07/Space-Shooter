# Space-Shooter

Shooter video games, also known as shooters, are a type of action video game 
in which the focus is almost entirely on defeating the character's enemies with the 
weapons provided by the player. These weapons are typically firearms or other long-range weapons. Shooter games put the player's spatial awareness, reflexes, and speed 
to the test in both single-player and networked multiplayer settings. Shooter games are 
divided into several subgenres that share the focus on the actions of the avatar engaging 
in combat with a weapon against both code-driven NPC enemies and other avatars 
controlled by other players.
Shoot 'em ups (also known as shmups) are a type of shooter in which the player can 
move up, down, left, or right on the screen while firing straight ahead. Shoot 'em ups 
have similar gameplay but are frequently classified by viewpoint. This includes fixed-screen shooters like Space Invaders and Galaga.
The game developed in this project is a fixed-screen shooter called Space Shooter. The 
premise in Space Shooter is really simple: Your space piloting skills are the only thing 
standing between the Earth and a dangerous alien invasion, which you must stop only 
with the help of your loyal spaceship.
